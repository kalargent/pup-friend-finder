# Doggo Fren Finder 

This was the homework for week 13 of my coding boot camp. This week's challenge was to create a "friend finder" that provided users with a survey, and compares their answers to other people to find the best match. When the match is determined, the user gets a modal that displays their match's name and a photo. 

This was my very first full stack (minus DBs) project. 

Of course, matching people is boring, so this matching app is geared toward dogs! The initial array contains some internet fav dogs for maximum matching fun! 

Which dog will be your best match?

## Technologies Used 
* Node JS 
* Javascript 
* NPM Packages 
    * Express 
        * Routing 
        * Get and Post 
    * Path 
* HTML 
* CSS

## Features 
* A welcome page that explains what the site does. 
* A survey with multiple statements that help determine the dog's personality: 
    * Free text entry for name and photo (URL). 
    * Ten (10) questions with dropdowns that allow the dog to express how much each statement pertains to their personality. 
    * A submit button. 
        * When the form is submitted, the app calculates the dog's total score, and compares it to the other dogs in the array. 
        * The best match is determined and displayed (name and image).
    * The new dog is pushed to the existing array in memory. 

## Backlog 
* Validate that all fields have been completed upon form submit. 
* Mobile Responsiveness. 
* CSS Updates. 

## My Role 
I was the sole developer for this project. I did, however, spend many hour reviewing repos and videos for this project which means....
